# :snake:Snake
The game 'Snake' is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake, collecting food to increase its body length. The goal is to avoid collisions with the snake's own tail or the walls of the field.
# :scroll:Rules of the game
:video_game:Control: The player guides the snake's movement across the playing field using keyboard keys. The snake moves forward in the direction indicated by the player.

:green_apple:Food collection: The snake needs to collect food presented on the playing field. Every time the snake consumes food, its length increases.

:triangular_flag_on_post:Avoiding collisions: The player must prevent the snake from colliding with its own tail or the walls of the field. If the snake crashes into itself or the wall, the game ends.
